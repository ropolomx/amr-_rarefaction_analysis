# Methods

## Rarefaction curves

### Resistome

Rarefaction curves were generated for AMR data using two methods:

1. Rarefaction curves were also generated by using the `rarecurve` function of 
the `vegan` package of R [@vegan_oksanen_2017] based on the __number__ of reads 
sampled. In order to generate those curves, Kraken results were split by taxonomic 
level (Phylum, Order,Class, Family, Genus, and Species), and rarefied independently

### Microbiome

1. Rarefaction curves were also generated by using the `rarecurve` function of 
the `vegan` package of R [@vegan_oksanen_2017] based on the __number__ of reads 
sampled. In order to generate those curves, Kraken results were split by taxonomic 
level (Phylum, Order,Class, Family, Genus, and Species), and rarefied independently

In the case of the Kraken taxonomic classification data, the rarefaction curves 
were built only with the results from processing the reads with the `vegan` 
package of R.
